                <p> The meritocratic American dream implies that “if you’re smart enough and if you work hard enough", 
                you can secure a better future for yourself in this country. Literature on this topic has largely focused on 
                underprivileged students securing positions in universities, but few studies look into socioeconomic mobility 
                from higher education into the elite class. </p>

                <p> The employment rates of low socioeconomic status students in elite colleges who enter elite professions within 
                finance, consulting, and tech may seem irrelevant to the vast majority of working class Americans. However, 
                the entry level salary places these new graduates in the top 10 percentile of household income. This has key 
                implications. Recently, researchers cite the top ten percent of the income distribution as disproportionately 
                increasing its wealth and driving inequality. Furthermore, these entry level positions pave careers into powerful 
                government and corporate positions. These professions are therefore considered a contemporary gateway into 
                joining the U.S. economic elite.<br/> 
                <br/> 
                This study looks at data collected at Dartmouth College (n = 395) to understand if the role of social capital, cultural capital, 
                and human capital can explain the disparities in elite profession employment outcomes by socioeconomic class. </p>

                        <p> Capital manifests in the family structure in a variety of manners. For example, family wealth becomes a form of 
                            economic capital for the child to inherit. Economic capital plays an especially important role in distinguishing 
                            children with elite families from children with educated, middle class families. For example, inherited economic 
                            capital enables elite children to develop expensive in-group behaviors, such as having financially exclusive hobbies 
                            and signal belong through status symbols. The role of economic capital in educational disadvantages is not only intuitive 
                            but well-documented, and therefore serves as the key independent variable used to predict employment outcomes.

                            Bourdieu extensively discusses the role of social capital - resources accessible through interpersonal connections,

                            An important role of social capital involves the transmission of information via social relationships. 
                            Information provides basis for action, such as knowing how to prepare for interviews or how to gain entry to exclusive 
                            networking events. Coleman (1990) theorizes that we should evaluate the structural and functional aspect of social capital. 
                            In other words, the social capital index should assess a person’s to social capital as well as whether they leveraged
                            those connections into actual favors and resources. Many previous studies have managed to capture the effects of social capital 
                            on both educational outcomes and employment outcomes, but they do not sufficiently explain the full variation in hiring 
                            outcomes (Goddard 2003; Pager and Shepherd 2008).
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            More abstractly, the elite class’s preference for in-group culture is the underlying premise for why cultural capital 
                            plays such a big role in upward mobility. Cultural capital is, at best, vaguely defined as "transmissible parental cultural 
                            codes and practices capable of securing a return to their holders (Tzanakis 2011). Collins’ (1971) theory on educational 
                            stratification and disparities in job outcomes explains that high status groups construct employment requirements to 
                            monopolize the available opportunities through 
                            their cultural standards. As a result, the exclusion of people who lack in-group culture is legitimized and normalized, 
                            when in reality these non-cognitive personality traits have nothing to do with meritocratic skill and ability 
                            (Bourdieu and Passeron 1990; Collins 1971; Bourdieu and Passeron 1977).

                            Rivera’s recent study is the first to empirically confirm through analyzing interviews (n = 120) that culture serves as a vehicle for labor market sorting. 
                            According to her qualitative investigations, many interviewers would rank "culture fit", as determined by leisure 
                            activities, shared experiences, and self-presentation as the most important quality in determing who gets the job. 
                            In a separate study, Rivera identified the empirical effects of high-brow culture signals through a resume audit experiment.
                            She found that the higher class resume (e.g. sailing, classical music) received law firm interviews at a 16.25 percent rate as compared to 1.28 percent for the lower class resume (track and field, country music), 
                            controlling for gender and identical academic 
                            achievements.
