                    <h2>How does the veil of meritocracy operate in elite higher education institutions? Is socioeconomic mobility into the American elite possible through our elite higher education institutions?
                        Through what mechanisms are wealthy famillies able to confer major advantages to their children to 
                        maintain social class reproduction? This study dives into the role of social capital- who you know, cultural capital- 
                        your ability to navigate highbrow cultural codes, and human capital- your abilities and skills- in 
                        explaining employment outcomes disparities by socioeconomic class.

                <p> The meritocratic American dream implies that “if you’re smart enough and if you work hard enough", 
                you can secure a better future for yourself in this country. Literature on this topic has largely focused on 
                underprivileged students securing positions in universities, but few studies look into socioeconomic mobility 
                from higher education into the elite class. </p> 
                <br/> 

                <blockquote class="testimonial text-center bigtest">
                    <q>The meritocratic class has mastered the old trick of consolidating wealth </q> 
                </blockquote>
                
                <br/>
                <p> The employment rates of low socioeconomic status students in elite colleges who enter elite professions within 
                finance, consulting, and tech may seem irrelevant to the vast majority of working class Americans. However, 
                the entry level salary places these new graduates in the top 10 percentile of household income. This has key 
                implications. Recently, researchers cite the top ten percent of the income distribution as disproportionately 
                increasing its wealth and driving inequality. Furthermore, these entry level positions pave careers into powerful 
                government and corporate positions. These professions are therefore considered a contemporary gateway into 
                joining the U.S. economic elite.<br/> 
                <br/> 
                This study looks at data collected at Dartmouth College (n = 395) to understand if the role of social capital, cultural capital, 
                and human capital can explain the disparities in elite profession employment outcomes by socioeconomic class. </p>

                            </div>

                            <p> Upper class parents confer employment and educational advantages to their 
                                children through social connections, cultural codes, and educational opportunities.
                                Bourdieu extensively discusses the role of social capital - resources accessible through interpersonal connections, 
                                cultural capital - the ability to navigate upperclass cultural codes, and human capital- skills and talents. 
                            </p>
                            <img src="images/HD_results/bourdieu.jpg" alt="Bourdieu"/>

                                Capital manifests in the family structure in a variety of manners. For example, family wealth becomes a form of 
                                economic capital for the child to inherit. Economic capital plays an especially important role in distinguishing 
                                children with elite families from children with educated, middle class families. For example, inherited economic 
                                capital enables elite children to develop expensive in-group behaviors, such as having financially exclusive hobbies 
                                and signal belong through status symbols. The role of economic capital in educational disadvantages is not only intuitive 
                                but well-documented, and therefore serves as the key independent variable used to predict employment outcomes.
                                <br/>
                                <br/>
                                An important role of social capital involves the transmission of information via social relationships. 
                                Information provides basis for action, such as knowing how to prepare for interviews or how to gain entry to exclusive 
                                networking events. Coleman (1990) theorizes that we should evaluate the structural and functional aspect of social capital. 
                                In other words, the social capital index should assess a person’s to social capital as well as whether they leveraged
                                those connections into actual favors and resources. Many previous studies have managed to capture the effects of social capital 
                                on both educational outcomes and employment outcomes, but they do not sufficiently explain the full variation in hiring 
                                outcomes (Goddard 2003; Pager and Shepherd 2008).
                                <br/>
                                <br/>
                                More abstractly, the elite class’s preference for in-group culture is the underlying premise for why cultural capital 
                                plays such a big role in upward mobility. Cultural capital is, at best, vaguely defined as "transmissible parental cultural 
                                codes and practices capable of securing a return to their holders (Tzanakis 2011). Collins’ (1971) theory on educational 
                                stratification and disparities in job outcomes explains that high status groups construct employment requirements to 
                                monopolize the available opportunities through 
                                their cultural standards. As a result, the exclusion of people who lack in-group culture is legitimized and normalized, 
                                when in reality these non-cognitive personality traits have nothing to do with meritocratic skill and ability 
                                (Bourdieu and Passeron 1990; Collins 1971; Bourdieu and Passeron 1977). 
                                For example, Rivera identified the empirical effects of high-brow culture signals through a resume audit experiment.
                                She found that the higher class resume (e.g. sailing, classical music) received law firm interviews at a 16.25 percent rate as compared to 1.28 percent for the lower class resume (track and field, country music), 
                                controlling for gender and identical academic 
                                achievements.

                        Class achievement differences in entering the consulting industry can be explained away by 
                        higher human capital (as measured by grade point average),
                        social capital (professional favors and Information), and cultural capital (highbrow hobbies).

                    </h1>
                    <p> Having a higher cumulative GPA, larger professional network and tendency to ask for favors, 
                        and having highbrow hobbies all increased a student’s likelihood of entering the 
                        consulting industry over non-elite industries. </p>

                                that surveys lead to a lot of social desireability bias. </p>
